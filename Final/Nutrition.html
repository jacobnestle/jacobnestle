            <h2>Fat</h2>

            <h2>Protein</h2>
            <p>Proteins are macronutrients made up of amino acids. They are important for muscle development and recovery. Weightlifters often take protein supplements in order to reach their
            daily recommended protein intake to supplement muscle growth. Proteins are found in meats, beans, nuts, and dairy.</p>

            <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
            <p>Carbohydrates are split up into two groups, simple carbs (sugars) and complex carbs (starch and fibers). Complex carbs are very important in regards to bolstering your calorie intake and
            body recovery. Simple carbs are fast digesting and should be taken in smaller amounts. Some examples of simple carbs include fruit, energy drinks, and candy. Complex carbs include grains, pasta, beans, and corn</p>

            <h2>Calories</h2>
            <p>Calories tends to be a scary concept to a lot of people. The word tends to carry a negative connotation around it as something that harms your body and makes you fat, that should 
            be limited wherever possible. However, no matter your body, calories are very important as they give you the energy needed to perform any function. If your goal with fitness is to lose weight,
            then yes, you should be eating in a calorie deficit, meaning you expend more calories then you consume in a day. If your goal is to gain weight, then you should be in a calorie surplus, meaning you take in more
            calories than you expend in a day. Within your food are three macronutrients: fat, protein, and carbohydrates. They are all important to a healthy diet in their respective amounts. Click on this 
            link in order to discover how many calories, and amount of macronutrients, you should be consuming based on your body and fitness goals!
