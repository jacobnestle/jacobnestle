    <h1>The Implementation</h1>
    <h2>Workout Creation Tool</h2>
    <p>
        Using JQ functions, I can make the muscle page interactive and smooth looking so the user can click on the actual muscle groups to be led to different exercises. Javascript can be used so the user can add exercises to a list to create a workout plan
        that they can save.
    </p>
    <h2>Dietary Tool</h2>
    <p>
        Using math functions through javascript, the user can input their body weight and workout goal (May it be weight gain or loss) in order to retrieve back a calorie and macronutrient guideline for them to follow.
        The dietary tool will also include a few solid food recommendations per macronutrient to give the user an idea of what type of food they should consume to reach their goal.
