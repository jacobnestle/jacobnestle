    <h1>The Idea</h1>
    <p>
        I'd like to make a site that helps people get into lifting weights and fitness. It'll have information about the what exercises can be done for each muscle group,
        a workout creation tool, and a dietary tool to help people find out what food they should eat to reach their own personal goal.
    </p>

    <p>
        The workout creation tool will allow them to create and save a workout of the various exercises for each muscle group. The diet tool will help the user create a calorie and macronutrient (Carbohydrates, Fats, Protein) goal for them to follow depending on their goal
        (whether it be losing or gaining weight).
